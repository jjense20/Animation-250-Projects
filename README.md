# Animation 250-Projects
A collection of interactive animation files for ANIM-250, created using Adobe Animate and ActionScript 3.0

## Introduction

The purpose of these projects were to become more familiar with the **Adobe Animate** platform (which was a combination of re-learning how to do some art as well as **ActionScript 3.0**).

## Files & Requirements

There are no pre-requisites for viewing the given *.swf* and *.fla* files, however if you wish to download any of the files to work or view them I would suggest using [Adobe Animate](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html) as well as familiarize yourself with [Actionscript 3.0 documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/animate/using/actionscript.html) for working with the code for the animation.
